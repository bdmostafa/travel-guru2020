            "description": "Cox's Bazar is a city, fishing port, tourism centre and district headquarters in southeastern Bangladesh. It is famous mostly for its long natural sandy beach. Along the shore is an extensive area of beach and dunes. Most of the city is built on a floodplain that is lower in elevation than the dunes.",
            "longIntro": "The beach in Cox's Bazar has a gentle slope and with an unbroken length of 155 km (96 mi) it is often termed the longest natural unbroken sea beach in the world. The Cox's Bazar coastal plain was formed after the sea reached its present level around 6,500 years ago, with the area of the current floodplain originally forming a sediment sink that has since been gradually filled in by the Bakkhali river as well as smaller streams coming down from the hills.",
